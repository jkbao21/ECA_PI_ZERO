# ECA_PI_ZERO
A project to bring the full electra-core staking wallet to the pi zero


Recompiled source codes and binaries, along with compilation/installation instructions to follow shortly.



NOTE:

Current wallet binary still requires installing some dependancies before it will run.
The next update will include a standalone precompiled binary with all dependancies builtin.
